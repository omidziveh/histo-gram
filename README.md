# Persian Time Capsule Bot ðŸ“œ

**Version: Beta 1.0**

A daily Telegram bot that delivers a beautiful piece of art and history from Persian culture. Every day, it selects a new artifact from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection, uses an AI to write a rich description, and sends it to you.

-----

## Features

  * **Daily Art Delivery:** Automatically runs once a day to find and send a new art piece.
  * **Museum-Quality Content:** Fetches high-quality images and verified data directly from **The Met's** public collection API.
  * **AI-Powered Descriptions:** Uses a powerful AI model to generate engaging, informative descriptions in Persian for each art piece, including the ruling dynasty of the era.
  * **Smart Logging:** Keeps track of every piece of art it has sent to ensure you never see the same one twice.
